# PC-Optimization-and-Supply-Chain-Integration
To implement AI-powered solutions for optimizing PC hardware configurations, real-time hardware tracking, and supply chain management, you can use Python and integrate machine learning models, data collection tools, and APIs. Below, I provide a Python-based approach that combines AI-driven hardware recommendations, real-time tracking, and supply chain integration. This solution will help in optimizing hardware configurations and ensuring that inventory levels match demand efficiently.
Key Components of the System:

    Hardware Recommendation System: Uses AI to suggest optimal hardware configurations based on customer needs.
    Real-Time Hardware Tracking: Tracks hardware in real-time using APIs or database systems.
    Supply Chain Management Integration: Integrates with inventory management systems to optimize stock levels.

1. Hardware Recommendation System

The first task is to implement an AI model for hardware configuration optimization. This can be done using machine learning, where the system learns from historical data of PC builds and customer preferences.

Hereâ€™s an example Python code that implements a simple recommendation system using scikit-learn.
Install necessary libraries:

pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy

AI-Powered Hardware Recommendation System:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Sample data for customer hardware configurations (example)
data = {
    'CPU': ['Intel i5', 'Intel i7', 'AMD Ryzen 5', 'AMD Ryzen 7', 'Intel i9'],
    'GPU': ['NVIDIA GTX 1660', 'NVIDIA RTX 3070', 'NVIDIA RTX 3080', 'AMD Radeon RX 5700', 'NVIDIA GTX 1080'],
    'RAM': [8, 16, 16, 32, 32],
    'Storage': [256, 512, 512, 1024, 1024],
    'Price': [500, 800, 850, 1200, 1500]
}

# Convert the data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features (CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage)
features = df[['CPU', 'GPU', 'RAM', 'Storage']].copy()
features['CPU'] = features['CPU'].apply(lambda x: 0 if 'Intel' in x else 1)  # Simplified encoding for CPU
features['GPU'] = features['GPU'].apply(lambda x: 0 if 'NVIDIA' in x else 1)  # Simplified encoding for GPU
features['RAM'] = features['RAM']  # No need for encoding as it's numerical
features['Storage'] = features['Storage']  # No need for encoding as it's numerical

# Target variable (Price)
target = df['Price']

# Using Nearest Neighbors to find similar hardware configurations
model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
model.fit(features)

# Function to recommend hardware based on user input
def recommend_hardware(user_input):
    user_input_encoded = pd.DataFrame([user_input], columns=['CPU', 'GPU', 'RAM', 'Storage'])
    
    # Apply the same encoding logic to the user's input
    user_input_encoded['CPU'] = user_input_encoded['CPU'].apply(lambda x: 0 if 'Intel' in x else 1)
    user_input_encoded['GPU'] = user_input_encoded['GPU'].apply(lambda x: 0 if 'NVIDIA' in x else 1)
    
    # Find the nearest neighbor (most similar configuration)
    distances, indices = model.kneighbors(user_input_encoded)
    
    # Return the recommended hardware configuration
    recommended = df.iloc[indices[0][0]]
    return recommended

# Example user input for hardware recommendation
user_input = {'CPU': 'Intel i7', 'GPU': 'NVIDIA RTX 3070', 'RAM': 16, 'Storage': 512}
recommended_hardware = recommend_hardware(user_input)
print("Recommended hardware configuration:", recommended_hardware)

Explanation:

    Recommendation System: This model uses a Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend a hardware configuration based on the user input. You can expand the model by adding more complex features, such as user preferences or historical data.
    Feature Encoding: The CPUs and GPUs are simplified into numeric values (0 for Intel, 1 for AMD, etc.). You can enhance this with more complex encoding methods like one-hot encoding.

2. Real-Time Hardware Tracking

For real-time hardware tracking, you would likely need to interact with an inventory system, such as an API for your hardware inventory or use a database to store real-time stock levels.

import requests

# Example API to track hardware inventory
def track_hardware_inventory(product_id):
    url = f"https://api.hardware-inventory.com/track/{product_id}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        inventory_data = response.json()  # Assuming JSON response
        return inventory_data
    else:
        return None

# Example usage
product_id = 123  # ID of a product in the inventory
inventory_data = track_hardware_inventory(product_id)

if inventory_data:
    print(f"Product ID: {product_id} | Stock: {inventory_data['stock_level']}")
else:
    print(f"Product ID: {product_id} | No data available.")

Explanation:

    API Integration: This script simulates an API request to fetch real-time stock levels for a given product from an external inventory management system.

3. Supply Chain Management Integration

For integrating with supply chain management systems (e.g., tracking suppliers, shipments, etc.), you can use APIs or integrate with ERP software. Here's an example of integrating with a basic supply chain API:

import requests

# Example API for supply chain management
def fetch_supplier_data(product_id):
    url = f"https://api.supplychain.com/supplier/{product_id}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        supplier_data = response.json()  # Assuming JSON response
        return supplier_data
    else:
        return None

# Example usage
product_id = 123  # ID of a product to check the supplier
supplier_data = fetch_supplier_data(product_id)

if supplier_data:
    print(f"Product ID: {product_id} | Supplier: {supplier_data['supplier_name']}")
else:
    print(f"Product ID: {product_id} | No supplier data available.")

Explanation:

    Supply Chain API Integration: This is a basic example of fetching supplier data from a supply chain management API. It can be expanded to include shipment tracking, supplier lead times, and stock replenishment logic.

Conclusion:

    AI-powered PC Configuration Optimization: The recommendation system suggests optimal hardware configurations based on customer needs, and this can be further refined using more advanced models (e.g., collaborative filtering, neural networks).
    Real-Time Hardware Tracking: The system can integrate with an inventory API to track hardware availability in real-time.
    Supply Chain Integration: You can integrate AI with supply chain APIs to ensure the hardware is available and delivered on time.

This solution can be further expanded and customized based on your clients' specific needs, business logic, and scale.
